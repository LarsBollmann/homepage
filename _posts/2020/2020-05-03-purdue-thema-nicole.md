The study discussed in this thesis considers the hypothetical production
of top squarks at hadron colliders, with the assumption that top squarks
will always decay into top quarks and neutralinos of a small mass of
approximately 0&thinsp;GeV.
Targeting the dileptonic final states, the \\(\Delta{\phi}\\) distribution
between the two charged lepton final products in the laboratory frame are
used to set limits on the production of top squarks of various masses. Limits are
first derived from the results of the CMS measurement using
35.9&thinsp;fb⁻¹ of data recorded at the LHC in 2016, with a center of mass energy of 13&thinsp;TeV. 
Then, an extrapolation is made by scaling the 2016 data to a higher luminosity of 
300&thinsp;fb⁻¹ and reducing the systematic uncertainties.
It is shown that no exclusion on the top squark range can be made for
the combination of a top squark mass range of 160&thinsp;GeV to 
300&thinsp;GeV with a fixed small neutralino mass almost equal to zero.
